# Connect Four AI ðŸŽ®

I first built this game in Python just to understand how the Minimax algorithm works as well it a Game Development Project. It was all terminal-based â€” no visuals, just numbers and moves. But the crazy part is, on the day where we were supposed to present in front of class. There was a slight error and it wouldn't work as expected. Luckily I had saved all demo pictures and we used that always with a backup. Later I found out that the code wouldn't work while presenting because of a missing square bracket which was accidentally deleted while carrying laptop to the table.

Later, I wanted to make it more playable, so I challenged myself to rebuild it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€” with a working AI opponent, clickable grid, and a polished interface.

Now you can play Connect Four right in the browser â€” against an AI that actually thinks!
